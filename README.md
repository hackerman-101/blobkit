blobkit is a copy of blooket made completely by ai. the name "blobkit" is a tribute to blobby boi, who inpired me to start my journey in researching exploits and unblockers, until i eventually went on to coding blobkit. the idea started when i joined the blacket discord server. somebody called "paradox" commented on a post for an idea about 4 new blooks. the blooks were made with high quality, but paradox commented saying that the blooks were not in the style of Blacket. this made me think that my blooks i created would not get accepted into blacket. this made me create a blooket remix inspired by blacket. i decided that since i do not know how to code, i used AI to create this project that is in beta.
